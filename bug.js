This bug occurs when using the Expo SDK's `Image` component with a remote image URL that returns a 404 error.  The standard error handling mechanisms provided by Expo may not always catch this specific error, leading to unexpected behavior or a silently failing image.  Instead of displaying an error placeholder or a default image, the `Image` component may render nothing at all, making it difficult to debug.
